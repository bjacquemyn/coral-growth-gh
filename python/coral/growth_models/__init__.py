"""Dynamic registry for the available coral growth models.

Historically this package eagerly imported a hard-coded list of modules.
That meant missing optional modules (e.g., experimental algorithms that are
not shipped with the repository) triggered an ``ImportError`` during package
import.  In Grasshopper this surfaced as a misleading
``Could not import 'coral.growth_models.simple_branching'`` runtime error even
though :mod:`simple_branching` was present and valid.  The eager import of the
non-existent :mod:`fungal_surface` module was the culprit.

To make the package robust we now discover modules dynamically at import time.
Any ``*.py`` module in this directory is imported and re-exported through
``__all__``.  Missing optional modules are simply skipped, eliminating spurious
errors while still keeping the original plug-and-play behaviour.
